# What is CRUD?

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It is a set of basic operations that are commonly used in database management systems and web applications.

Here's what each operation means:

Create: This operation involves creating a new record or object in a database or application. For example, you might create a new user account by filling out a registration form.

Read: This operation involves retrieving information from a database or application. For example, you might retrieve a list of all user accounts, or you might retrieve the details of a specific user account.

Update: This operation involves modifying an existing record or object in a database or application. For example, you might update a user account by changing the user's email address.

Delete: This operation involves removing a record or object from a database or application. For example, you might delete a user account that is no longer needed.

Together, these four operations form the basic building blocks for many types of applications and database systems. They allow users to create, view, modify, and delete data as needed, providing a powerful tool for managing information.

# What is implemented?

This is the basic model used to demostrate the  Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality using redux.

## On Webapplication (REACT JS)

1) Application Internal Routing has been implemented.

2) REDUX is implemented.

4) Small react component is created for each functionality.

## On Server (Express)

1) Server side internal routing is implemented.

2) REST api is implemented.

3) Nodemon is isntalled to quick reload on server.

# How to run?

This application contain two folder app that has the web application and ServerFiles that contain server of the application, we need to install node module for both side.

First a node must be install on your machine. To install Node.js on your system, follow these steps:

Go to the official Node.js website at https://nodejs.org and download the installer for your operating system.

Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

In the installation wizard, you can choose whether to install the recommended version of Node.js or select a different version. You can also choose which components to install, such as the npm package manager.

After the installation is complete, open your command prompt or terminal and type node -v to verify that Node.js is installed and check the version number.

You can start using Node.js by creating a new file with the .js extension and writing your JavaScript code in it. Then, run the file by typing node filename.js in the command prompt or terminal.

That's it! You should now have Node.js installed and ready to use on your system.

1) Now open your vs code and import the folder of CRUD-REDUX-MERN.
2) Then move to the directory of app in terminal.
3) Now type 'npm i' and press enter. This will install all the dependencies.
4) Now open another terminal in vs code and locate the ServerFiles.
5) Type 'npm i'.
6) Good news you have install all the required dependencies.
7) Now move to ServerFiles terminal and type 'npm start', This will start the server.
8) Now move to app terminal and type 'npm start', This will start the web application.
